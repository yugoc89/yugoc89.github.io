There’d been absolute nothing to use for the website but only one concept: ‘gentle, warm and bright like the sun’.<br>I went to the salon for photo shooting for the first time of my work and now the photos are used on the main background.<br>Also I’ve introduced some cool and trendy animations like Javascript Ajax load and the whole website works seamlessly without paginations.",
